# sentiment-analysis-using-VADER

Start by opening and reading the Appraoch.pdf file in thie repo to understand my appraoch and how I took on the questions asked my the assignment.

I am trying to improve/tinker with the code. I won't break the code(hopefully) since I am trying to add a new method to analyse the brand being targetted in any specific tweet.
